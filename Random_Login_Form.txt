Random Login Form (http://ringzer0team.com/challenges/171) WriteUp

Welcome to this (simple and short) writeup for the RingZer0 CTF,
this time we'll be solving the (at time of writing) fourth SQL injection challenge.

So, let's open the challenge page, and we'll be facing two form, first a login one, and
then a register one.

Trying to register a new user

"
ciccio your account has been created
"

and then log in with the same credentials, we can see it works as expected, 
but (quite predictable indeed), this is not enough:

"
Welcome back ciccio, Seem like your not an admin!
"

So how to become an admin?

Ruling out for now bruteforcing and strict sql injection techniques,
first thoughts could be to look for some possible confusions (and/or sloppiness)
between the web app and the database.

After some tinkering, and some cool idea which not worked (unicode similar characters),
let's try something simpler (hoping for a very sloppy backend management) and register
a " admin" (without quotes, they're here just to highligth the space in the string):

"
admin your account has been created
"

that looks good, now let's login with that:

"
Welcome back admin FLAG-0Kg64o8M9gPQfH45583Mc0jc3u
"

It worked.

But why it worked? Let's lay down some hypothesis (which could well be totally wrong):

the idea is that (at time of sign up) the username is treated in the backend script "as is",
without being stripped/trimmed, (and we could guess a select with it will yield nothing, so all good)
then it's passed to the database where the trimming is done and insert'd in a table which
primary key is not the username (probably some auto-increment id) and where there is not a unique
constraint on the username column (it's already checked in the script, why redo it?), so this
confusion let us inject a new admin entry and, for the login query/script to be in fact an admin.

If someone was asking where my hypothesis for the database table layout came out from, well, my first
idea was that there were some kind of upsert in the backend, but once checked it (tryng to reregister
the same user), it seemed wrong:

"
This account already exist.
"

so the second thought remained (imho) the most probable one.
